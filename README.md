# Module 5 Challenge - Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This application is my solution to the Module 5 Challenge of the Coding Bootcamp.
This application allows users to save events (as text) to a calendar represetning a typical workday from 9-5pm.
Through this project I learned how to handle time formats using dayjs, and improved my skills on handling the relationship between JavaScript and HTML.
